In 1992, MMAP was further empowered by becoming a trust, and in September 2009 it was reorganized into MDEAT by ordinance 09-70.</p>\n<p>Since its inception, MDEAT&rsquo;s focus has been on addressing socioeconomic disparities within the community. MDEAT does so by focusing on the individual (i.e., youth and individual family member support), building neighborhoods through the expansion of homeownership, and supporting the foundation of strong businesses and economic development via job creation, entrepreneurship, business retention, and expansion. These three gears - family, neighborhood, and business - work together to connect the community to resources, funding, and programming that together create whole communities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.miamidade.gov/global/government/boards/economic-advocacy-trust.page\">Board Members</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/global/navigation/prindex.page?ORGANIZATIONNAME=Economic%20Advocacy%20Trust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read press releases</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.miamidade.gov/global/government/trusts/economicadvocacy/targeted-urban-areas.page\">Maps throughout Miami-Dade County</a></li>\n</ul>","marks":[]}],"markDefs":[]}],"mduid":"org1477078752386373","contactLabel":"Contact Us","contactUrl":"/global/government/trusts/economicadvocacy/contact.page","leaderTitle":"other","leaderTitleOther":"Executive Director","leaderName":"William \"Bill\" Diggs","leaderUrl":"/global/government/biographies/economic-advocacy-trust.page","locations":[{"_type":"object","_key":"hiye4f","location":"loc1496409739736747","locationSpecifics":"Suite 2132","telephone":"305-375-5661","fax":"305-375-5651","email":"","url":"/global/government/trusts/economicadvocacy/home.page"}],"socialMedia":[{"_type":"object","_key":"1bept","socialChannel":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/MDEATInfo","socialChannelTitle":""},{"_type":"object","_key":"vqj428","socialChannel":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/mdeatinfo","socialChannelTitle":""}]}
